1. User authentication
    There should be a way for the server to know that a client is noe a malicious user, that is people with no foul intentions should be able to make accounts/symbols.

2. No user crosses "lines"
    There should be a way to ensure that the user have justification for the amount of symbols they have. No one should be able to just randomly make a billion shares of google/apple in their accounts

3. Data integrity
    There should be a way to ensure that the data sent by a user has not been tampered with in transit

4. Sanity checks for input
    The server should perform proper sanity checks while parsing any input received from a user/client to avoid the possiblity of things like SQL injection

5. Robust account management
    No user should be able to tamper with another user's positions account information

6. Order matching sense
    No order should be matched by an open order that belongs to the same account
